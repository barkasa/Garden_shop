The 5% coupon only works once the first time you enter your phone number, it is written in the localStorage, then you can see this discount in the shopping basket on the first purchase. 
Information about the purchase with a 5% discount will also be recorded in the localStorage. 
Subsequent purchases cannot receive this discount. 

...if the discount does not work, you need to clear localStorage!!!


The adaptive version has implemented a Burger menu with a pop-up modal window. 

On the product page, a modal window has also been implemented, if you click on the picture, to enlarge and view the picture in detail.
